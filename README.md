A vaporwave-inspired puzzle game in which you'll pick up colored masks that affect
similarly colored things, with the effect defined by the shape of each mask.

Move around with WASD and mouse; pick up or drop masks with left-click; wear held masks
with right-click.

Reach the glowing doorway to proceed!
